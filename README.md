# Project Title: Inventory Management System

This project is an inventory management system. It contains functionality to allow users to create, update, read and delete (CRUD) customer details, items and orders in an SQL database (called IMS). This application also allows items to be added and removed from the orders. It is simple to use and connects via JDBC to a local instance of MySQL.
